#logic to add admin user from configured environmnet variable during app initialization if it doesnt already exits in db


'''
Explanation:

Purpose: This script sets up an administrative user for your Flask application, ensuring there is at least one admin user in the system. It uses environment variables to obtain the credentials and handles cases where the admin user might already exist.

How it Works:
Retrieves ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD from environment variables.
Checks if an admin user with the specified username already exists in the database.
If not, it creates a new user with the provided credentials, hashes the password, and saves it to the database.
Handles errors, including database integrity issues and other exceptions, and performs a rollback if necessary.

Where itâ€™s Used: This file is used during the application initialization process to ensure that an admin user is present before the application is fully operational. It is typically invoked as part of the setup or deployment process.

Raises:
        ValueError: If environment variables for ADMIN_USERNAME or ADMIN_PASSWORD are not set.
